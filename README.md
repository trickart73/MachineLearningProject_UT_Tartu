# Predicting satisfaction with health of Estonian school workers

## Machine Learning project - Autumn Semester 2020 (Kerli Mooses, Maarja Pajusalu, Liisi Panov, Victor Rebecq)

### Abstract
We finally managed to have nearly 80% of accuracy with different techniques, on some predictions (like if someone is healthy).
We also managed to tell that is really hard to predict this kind of stuff because there is a huge lack of data.
